# UH ITS AskBot

Welcome to UH ITS AskBot, your go-to conversational AI designed to enhance the efficiency of the University of Hawaii's Information Technology Services (ITS) Ask Us team. Our AI is trained on a vast knowledge base consisting of hundreds of publicly accessible webpages, all aimed at streamlining user support and making information retrieval a breeze.

## Project Overview

This project is part of our participation in Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC) 2023, where our goal is to alleviate the workload of the UH ITS Ask Us team by providing a powerful AI tool that improves the user experience and operational efficiency. We've built an intuitive and reactive user interface to ensure smooth and seamless interactions.
